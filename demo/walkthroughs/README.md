# OctoCAT Supply Chain Management - Demo Walkthroughs

Comprehensive demo environment showcasing GitHub's enterprise features using a modern TypeScript web application (React frontend + Express API) with an OctoCat Style!

## 🚀 Quick Setup

**Many demos can be shown without an IDE!** Most GitHub features (Issues, Projects, Actions, GHAS, Pull Requests) are web-based and don't require local development setup.

### For IDE-Based Demos

#### Option 1: Codespaces (Recommended)

- ✅ Zero setup - everything pre-configured
- ✅ Docker and dependencies included
- ✅ Automatic API endpoint detection for browser and local VS Code
- ❌ Some Copilot MCP demos (e.g., Playwright) won't work

#### Option 2: Local Checkout

- ✅ Full functionality including all MCP demos
- ✅ Better performance for intensive tasks
- ❌ Requires local setup (see [main README](../../README.md) for instructions)
- **Requirements**: Docker, GitHub PAT with repo permissions

### (optional) VSCode Insiders

You don't need VS Code Insiders unless demoing preview features. In Codespaces, switch via the gear icon (bottom-left) → `Switch to Insiders Version...`
